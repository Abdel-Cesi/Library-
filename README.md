Library and Book management in C++


This advanced book manager written in C++ is a console-based library management system. It has been designed to simulate the core functionalities of a real-world library management system and demonstrates the effective use of object-oriented programming principles.

The system revolves around two main classes, 'Book' and 'Library'.

The 'Book' class encapsulates the characteristics of a book, namely its 'title' and 'author'. It includes a 'display' method to print the details of the book.

The 'Library' class maintains a collection of books using a vector. It includes methods to perform various library operations, such as adding a new book to the collection, removing an existing book based on its title, and displaying the details of all the books in the collection.

In addition to these basic operations, the library system also includes advanced features to improve its functionality and usefulness. A 'searchBook' method is included that allows users to search for a book based on its title. If the book is found, its details are displayed; otherwise, an appropriate message is shown.

The system also includes a 'countBooks' method to return the total number of books currently in the library, and an 'isBookPresent' method to check whether a book is present in the library or not.

In order to help manage the library more effectively, two sorting methods, 'sortByTitle' and 'sortByAuthor', are also included. These methods sort the books in the library in ascending order based on their title or author, respectively.

This advanced book manager thus provides a robust and flexible system for managing a library's collection of books, offering a range of features that go beyond the basic add, remove, and display operations typically found in such systems.

The design of this system demonstrates the power of C++ for object-oriented programming, and how it can be effectively used to design and implement complex systems. It also shows how standard library features, such as vectors and algorithms, can be used to enhance the functionality and performance of a system.
